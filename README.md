# FactExtract

A UIMA annotator that persists annotations to a database. It's an alternative to the standard export functionality of Watson Explorer Content Analytics.

The standard export facilities allow field and facet values to be exported to a database. This is facility works well when the annotations in your collection are singleton values that map neatly to a field or facet. However, there are many cases where the standard export schema is problematic, for example:

- You don't won't to index the content, you just want to extract the annotations for further processing.
- The annotations you wish to export a true UIMA feature structures with features as well as just covered text and you want to export them as a coherent unit that maintains the relationship between the features.
- The star schema generated by the standard export is unappropriate for your needs.
